\section{Bayesian inference for MJPs}
In realistic situations, one only observes the MJP trajectory at
a finite set of times, and typically, these observations themselves
are noisy. There are then two challenges than the practitioner faces:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the MJP trajectory underlying the observations?
  \item What are the unknown parameters governing the dynamics of the 
    latent MJP?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trajectory inference for MJPs}
This problem was addressed in~\cite{RaoTeh13}, and extended to a broader 
class of MJPs (as well as other jump processes like semi-Markov processes
) in~\cite{RaoTeh12}. Both these schemes are centered on alternate
approaches to Gillespie's algorithm for sampling MJP trajectories, where we
introduce auxiliary {\em thinned} candidate jump times. 
\cite{RaoTeh13} follows a classical approach called 
{\em uniformization}~\cite{Jen1953}, while in~\cite{RaoTeh12}, this was
extended to a more general dependent thinning approach. We outline
the latter below: it is more general, and we are not aware of any work
before~\cite{RaoTeh12} that describes it.

Recall that the diagonal elements of the rate matrix $A_i$ give the 
rate at which the MJP leaves state $i$ for any other state. Importantly,
the parameters are set up so that self-transitions cannot occur. Now,
for each parameter $A_i$, introduce an additional parameter $\Omega_i \ge A_i$;
\cite{RaoTeh12} suggest setting $\Omega_i = 2 A_i$. Assuming the system is
in state $i$, we sample a {\em candidate} transition-time from an
exponential, now with rate $\Omega_i$. The system remains in state $i$
until this time, after which it moves to state $j \neq i$ with probability
$B_{ij} = A_{ij}/\Omega_i$. The system continues to remain in its current 
state with probability $1-A_i/\Omega_i$. 
These self-transitions correct for the extra candidate transition times
produced by the higher rate $\Omega_i$, and~\cite{RaoTeh12} show that
trajectories sampled this way have the same distribution as trajectories
sampled according to Gillespie's algorithm. The uniformization
scheme of~\cite{Jen1953,RaoTeh13} uses a single $\Omega \ge A_i\  \forall i$
(e.g.\ $\Omega = 2 \max_i A_i$). Since this $\Omega$ is independent of
state, we no longer need to sequentially generate the thinned variables;
instead, we sample a set of candidate transition times from a rate-$\Omega$
Poisson process, and then assign state values by running a 
discrete-time Markov chain with transition matrix $B = I + \frac{1}{\Omega}A$.

Introducing the thinned variables allowed~\cite{RaoTeh13} to develop
a novel and efficient MCMC sampler. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\\
\textbf{Given the MJP trajectory $(S,T)$, sample a new set of thinned 
candidate times $U$}: %\cite{RaoTeh12} show that 
These are distributed as a piecewise-constant inhomogeneous Poisson process
with intensity $\Omega_{S(t)}-A_{S(t)}$. Sampling from this is
straightforward.\\
\textbf{Given the thinned and actual transition times $(T \cup U)$
from the last iteration (but discarding all state information), 
sample a new trajectory}:
    Conditioned on the skeleton $T \cup U$, the set of candidate jump
    times is fixed, and trajectory inference reduces to inference for
    the familiar discrete-time hidden Markov model (HMM) with transition
    matrix $B$. \cite{RaoTeh13} suggest using the forward-filtering
    backward-sampling (FFBS) algorithm: this is an efficient dynamic 
    programming algorithm that makes a forward pass through the
    finite set of candidate times, sequentially updating the 
    distribution over states. 
    %at each time accounting for all observations in the previous interval. 
    Between any two consecutive time points separated by an interval
    $\Delta_t$, the system
    remain in a fixed state, with the likelihood for a state $i$ consisting
    of two parts: the likelihood under state $i$ of all observations 
    falling in that interval, and a term $\Omega_i\exp(-\Omega_i\Delta t)$,
    the probability that the next candidate time occurs after a wait
    $\Delta t$ under state $i$.
    Having reached the end, the algorithm then
    makes a backward pass through the candidate times, sequentially
    sampling the state at any time given the state at the following
    time. 

    ~\cite{RaoTeh12} show that the resulting Markov chain targets
    the desired posterior distribution over trajectories, and is 
    ergodic for any choice of $\Omega_i$'s strictly greater than the
    $A_i$'s.

\subsection{Parameter inference for MJPs}
In practice, the MJP parameters themselves are unknown: often,
these are the quantities of primary interest when studying a dynamical
system. A Bayesian approach
places a prior $p(\theta)$ over these unknown variables, and the
resulting posterior distribution $p(\theta|X)$ is approximated
with samples drawn by Gibbs sampling. In particular, for an arbitrary 
initialization of the parameters and the trajectory, one repeats the
following two steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sample a new trajectory from the conditional 
    $p(S_{new}(t)|X,S_{old}(t),\theta)$ following \cite{RaoTeh12}
  \item Sample a new $\theta$ from the conditional $p(\theta_{new}|X,S_{new}(t))$
\end{itemize}
The last distribution depends on a set of sufficient statistics of the 
MJP trajectory: how
much time is spent in each state, and the number of transitions
between each pair of states. 
%Given these, sample a new $\theta$ from the conditional $p(\theta|X,S(t))$. 
In special circumstances, $\theta$ can be directly sampled from its 
conditional distribution, otherwise, one has to use a Markov kernel like
Metropolis-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to update $\theta$. 

Such a Gibbs sampling approach comes with a well known limitation:
because of coupling between path and parameters, it can explore parameter 
and path space very sluggishly. In Figure~\ref{fig:conf1} we show
both the distribution of a component of $\theta$ conditioned
only on the observations, and conditioned on both the observations 
as well as a realization of the MJP trajectory: observe how much
more concentrated the latter is compared to the former. The
coupling is strengthened as the trajectory grows longer and longer, and
the Gibbs sampler can mix very poorly for situations with
long observation periods, even if the observations themselves are
sparse and only mildly informative about the parameters.

For the discrete-time case, this problem of parameter-trajectory
coupling can be circumvented by marginalizing out the MJP trajectory 
and directly sampling from the posterior over parameters $p(\theta|X)$.
In its simplest form, this approach involves proposing a new parameter
$\theta$ from some proposal distribution $q(\theta_{new}|\theta_{old})$,
and then accepting or rejecting according to the usual
Metropolis-Hastings probability. This requires calculating the marginal 
probability of the observations $p(X|\theta)$, integrating out
the exponential number of possible latent trajectories. Fortunately
this marginal probability is a by-product of the forward-backward
algorithm used to same a new trajectory, and so that no 
additional computational burden is involved. The algorithm then is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Propose a new parameter $\theta^*$ from some proposal distribution
    $q(\theta^*|\theta)$
  \item Run the forward pass of the forward-backward algorithm to 
    obtain the marginal likelihood of the observations, $p(X|\theta^*)$
  \item Accept the proposed $\theta^*$ according to the MH probability 
    $\min(1,\frac{p(X,\theta^*)q(\theta|\theta^*)}{p(X,\theta)q(\theta^*|\theta)})$.
  \item If desired, a new trajectory sample can be obtained by
    completing the backward pass of the forward-backward algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A marginal sampler for MJP parameters} 
Constructing such a marginal sampler over the MJP parameters by
integrating out the hidden trajectory is less straightforward:
the set of transition times is unbounded, with individual elements
unconstrained over the observation interval $[0,T]$.
%Naively calculating this marginal probability for the continuous-time
%case is not straightforward, as there is no finite set of candidate
%times to make a pass over. 
One approach~\cite{FearnSher2006} is to instead make a sequential 
forward pass through all observations, using the matrix-exponential
operator to marginalize out the infinite number of possible 
continuous-time trajectories linking two successive times. As
demonstrated in~\cite{RaoTeh13} however, this approach has a number of 
drawbacks: it scales cubically, rather than quadratically with the 
number of states, it cannot exploit structure like sparsity in the 
transition matrix, and can depend in not trivial ways on the exact 
nature of the observation process.

%and involves expensive computations that scale with the number of
%observations rather than the actual dynamics of the system of interest.

A second approach is particle MCMC~\cite{Andrieu10}. Here, one uses 
particle filtering to obtain an unbiased estimate of the marginal 
probability $p(X|\theta)$; this is then plugged into the 
Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. While the resulting MCMC 
sampler targets the correct posterior distribution~\cite{Andrieu09}, 
the resulting scheme resulting scheme does not exploit the structure 
of the MJP, and we show that it can be quite inefficient.

Work in~\cite{RaoTeh13, RaoTeh12} demonstrates the benefits of
the thinning-based approach over matrix exponential and particle-MCMC
approaches for trajectory inference. In the next section, we outline
a \naive\  first attempt at extending this approach to parameter inference.
We describe why this approach is not adequate, and describe our
final algorithm in the following section.
