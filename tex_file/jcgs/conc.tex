\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed a novel Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for parameter 
inference in Markov jump processes. We use a representation called 
uniformization to update the MJP parameters with state-values marginalized 
out, although still conditioning on a random Poisson grid. The 
distribution of this grid depends on the MJP parameters, significantly 
slowing down MCMC mixing. We propose a novel symmetrization scheme to get 
around this dependency. In our experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness 
of this scheme, which outperforms a number of competing baselines.

There are a number of interesting directions for future research.
Our focus was on Metropolis-Hastings algorithms for parameter inference,
and though we briefly considered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, it is interesting
to more thoroughly investigate how our ideas extend to this, and other 
schemes like slice sampling~\cite{Nea2003a}. Another direction is to develop
and study similar schemes for more complicated hierarchical models like
mixtures of MJPs or coupled MJPs. From a theoretical viewpoint, it is
important is to complement our empirical studies with theoretical analyses 
of the mixing properties of our proposed scheme. Finally, we are applying 
our ideas to other real-world applications from finance and genetics.
